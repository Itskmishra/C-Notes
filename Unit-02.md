## Comments
Comments are the lines in the code ignored by the compiler (will not be executed). It is for our reference of the code only.

#### Single-line Comments

Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (`//`).

Any text after `//` two forward slashes is considered as comment.Â 

```text-plain
//This is a single-line comment 
```

#### Multi-line Comments

Multi-line comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`.

Any text between `/*` and `*/` will be a comment.

```text-x-csrc
/*
This is a multi-line comment.
*/
```
