C is a general-purpose programming language that was created by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Laboratories in 1972. Despite being an old language, C remains very popular today. This is because it is considered a fundamental language in the field of computer science.

C is closely associated with UNIX, as it was developed specifically for writing the UNIX operating system.
