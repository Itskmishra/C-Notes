# Loop's

Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is reached. In C we have two type of loops **while** and **for**.

## while

The `while` loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is `true`:

```text-x-csrc
while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```

## for loop

When you know exactly how many times you want to loop through a block of code, use the `for` loop instead of a `while` loop:

```text-x-csrc
for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```
